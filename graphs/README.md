# How to use

Enter the following command in the directory
```
make
```
This will generate all the .o files and link them to generate an executable file.

Now you can see the executable file generated with name **a.out**

To run the program:
```
./a.out file.txt
```
The file named **file.txt** has the adjacency matrix of the graph being worked with.

Review the code well as I have added BFS, DFS, out_degree, in_degree, is_directed, Dijkstra functions into one.

This code is a little different as I have tried to implement abstraction here. Read more about abstraction in C.
